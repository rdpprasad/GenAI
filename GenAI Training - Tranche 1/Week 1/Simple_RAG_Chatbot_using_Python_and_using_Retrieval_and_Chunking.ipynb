It explores optical confinement in waveguide detectors, focusing on how the width of the BPD (𝑊𝑃𝐷) affects optical confinement. The document uses a LUMERICAL mode solver to analyze the fundamental TE mode in detectors with varying widths. It also discusses calculations for heterodyne coherent receivers, including formulas for optical power on photodiodes (PDs). Additionally, the document mentions implementing Particle Swarm Optimization, detailing how velocity and position of particles are updated within the swarm. Several parameters used for simulation are listed in tables.\n",
