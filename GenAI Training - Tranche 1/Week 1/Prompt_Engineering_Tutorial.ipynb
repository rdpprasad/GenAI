        "2. One-shot Prompting: Providing a single example in the prompt to guide the model's response.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Few-shot Prompting: Providing a few examples in the prompt to illustrate the desired output format and style.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Instruction Prompting: Giving explicit instructions within the prompt to direct the model's behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Chain-of-Thought Prompting: Asking the model to think step-by-step before providing the final answer. This encourages the model to show its reasoning process.\n",

        "6. Role Prompting: Assigning a specific persona or role to the model within the prompt.\n",

        "9. Few-shot with Explanation: Similar to few-shot, but includes explanations for the provided examples.\n",

        "10. Step-by-step Reasoning: Explicitly asking the model to explain its reasoning process in steps.\n",

        "11. Self-Consistency Prompting: Asking the model to generate multiple possible answers and select the most likely one.\n",

        "12. Interactive Prompting: Designing the prompt to simulate an interactive conversation or question-answer flow.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. Negative Prompting: Specifying what the model should not do in its response.\n",
        "Few-shot with Format Constraints: Providing examples that demonstrate a specific required output format.\n",

        "15. Multi-step Task Decomposition: Breaking down a complex task into smaller, sequential steps within the prompt."
