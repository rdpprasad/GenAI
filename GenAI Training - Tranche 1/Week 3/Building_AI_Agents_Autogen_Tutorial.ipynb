For each node, we calculate the \"balance\" of coins, which represents the difference between the number of coins the node has and the number of coins it should have (which is 1).\n","\n","1.  **DFS Traversal:** The `dfs(node)` function recursively traverses the tree.\n","2.  **Balance Calculation:**\n","    *   It calculates the balance of the left and right subtrees recursively.\n","    *   The balance of the current node is calculated as `node.val + left_balance + right_balance - 1`.  This means:  (coins at the current node) + (excess/deficit from left subtree) + (excess/deficit from right subtree) - (1 coin that should be at the current node).\n","3.  **Move Calculation:** The absolute value of the left and right subtree balances represents the number of moves required to balance those subtrees. We add these to the total `moves`.  For example, if `left_balance` is 2, it means the left subtree has 2 extra coins that need to be moved up to the parent. If `left_balance` is -1, it means the left subtree needs 1 coin from the parent.\n","4.  **Base Case:** If a node is `None`, its balance is 0.\n","\n","**Time and Space Complexity:**\n","\n","*   **Time Complexity:** O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree. This is because we visit each node exactly once during the DFS traversal.\n","*   **Space Complexity:** O(H), where H is the height of the tree. This is due to the recursive call stack of the DFS. In the worst case (skewed tree), H can be equal to N, resulting in O(N) space complexity. In the best case (balanced tree), H is log(N), resulting in O(log N) space complexity.\n","\n","\n","--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","\n",">>>>>>>> EXECUTING CODE BLOCK 0 (inferred language is python)...\n","user_proxy (to assistant):\n","\n","exitcode: 0 (execution succeeded)\n","Code output: \n","2\n","3\n","4\n","\n","\n","--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","assistant (to user_proxy):\n","\n","The solution and explanation are well-structured and accurate.
